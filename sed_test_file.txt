Sed is a stream editor, which is a very useful TOOL for text processing. It works perfectly
with regular expressions and functions very well. what processing, the currently processed 
line is stored in a temporary buffer, called "pattern space", and then the sed command is uSED to process the contents of the buffer. After the processing is completed, the contents 
of the buffer are sent to the screen. Then process the next line, so repeat it until the end
of the file. The file content has not changed unless you use a redirect to store the output.
Sed is mainly used to automatically edit one or more files, simplify the repeated operation
of files, write conversion programs, etc.
